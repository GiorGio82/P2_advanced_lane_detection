The goals / steps of this project are the following:

The goal of this project is write a piece of code that finds road lanes from a video feed. The video feed is taken with a single camera installed in front of a car approximately at the centre of the vehicle.
Since a video is a sequence of images, the steps of this project are given per each image, as follows: 

*Camera calibration 
*Distortion correction
*Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view") 
*Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
*Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
*Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
*Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
*Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

to process the project video, please open the jupyter notebook and run all cells in order. 

in the same notebook there are also several cells that can be used to reproduce the images showed inthe writeup. To show those images, select a specific cell and uncomment the last line
